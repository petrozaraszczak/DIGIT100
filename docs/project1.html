                <img src="images/IMG_1362.jpg.jpg" alt="bridge1" />
                <figcaption>This was not my first time walking this
                    bridge on this path to the fields, but it
                    was the beginning of my discovery of
                    some new trails that eventually led to me
                    finding a unique portion of Four Mile
                    Creek that flows beneath the bridge. I
                    like the symmetrical perspective image
                    that I captured here with the bridge and
                    trees that leads to the trail and invites
                    you to continue walking. It is probably
                    my favorite photo. You can also see the
                    changing colors of the leaves from green
                    to orange both on the trees and the
                    fallen ones on the bridge.</figcaption>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/IMG_0146.jpg" alt="bridge2" />
                <figcaption>This is a part of the
                    bridge that is above
                    an active roadway, so
                    the walls are higher
                    and part of it is
                    covered. This image
                    shows the blue sky in
                    contrast to the trees
                    and concrete.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/IMG_1111.jpg.jpg" alt="flower" />
                <figcaption>These purple flowers caught my eye
                    down on the dirt trail close to the
                    river. This was a great opportunity for
                    a close-up image with vibrant colors.
                    I was going for a focused shot of the
                    flowers with a blurred background
                    behind them.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/IMG_0618.jpg" alt="drainpipe" />
                <figcaption>In this photo, I captured a perspective
                    shot of the water flowing into the
                    drainpipe. It was difficult to get the
                    camera to focus on everything all at
                    once, but I like how it turned out
                    focused on the middle of the image. The
                    movement of the water is what shows
                    up here, and it looks pretty cool.</figcaption>

            <figure>
                <img src="images//IMG_1081.jpg" alt="wet grass" />
                <figcaption>This image captures the fall colors well and
                    contrasts with the green grass and the
                    smooth water in the background. I edited
                    the image to emphasize the colors, and I
                    like how it turned out.</figcaption>
