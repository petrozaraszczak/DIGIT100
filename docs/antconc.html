        <section>George Wasnington tends to use words like <b>united</b> and <b>states</b> more than Trump as he was ths first president of the United States and was stating his plan for the young, new country. Donald Trump, seemed to use words like <b>America</b>, <b>people</b> and <b>immigration</b> a lot more than Washington as he is the most recent and current president  and talking about current  issues and is talking on a global scale.</section>

        <section>Both of these presidents refer to the United States at a higher frequency than any other 3 bit N-Gram. Trump refering to it less than Washington makes sense to me, as he was the first president and Trump was the 45th and 47th. Washington mentions phrases like <b>fellow citizens</b>, <b>will be laid</b>, <b>laid before you</b> and <b>fellow citizens</b> to set the ground of the new country. </section>

        <section>Both of these presidents refer to the United States at a higher frequency than any other 3 bit N-Gram. Washington is using the term to describe how the government represents the people and is using phrases like <b>brittanic majesty</b>, <b>indivisual states</b> and <b>catholic</b> to represnt where and how the country was founded on. Trump mainly used words such as <b>trade</b>, mentions governement spending and refers to other governments shows that he is refering to th US on a global scale.</section>
