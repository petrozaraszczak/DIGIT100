        <section>George Wasnington tends to use words like <b>constitution</b> and <b>Britain</b> more than Trump as he was ths first president of the United States and was stating his plan for the young, new country. Donald Trump, seemed to use words like <b>America</b>, <b>money</b> and mentioning the two political parties, <b>Democrats and Republicans</b> a lot more than Washington as he is the most recent and current president and is talking on a global scale.</section>

        <section>Both of these presidents refer to the United States at a higher frequency than any other 3 bit N-Gram. Trump refering to it less than Washington makes sense to me, as he was the first president and Trump was the 45th and 47th.</section>
