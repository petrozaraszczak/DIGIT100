               The most significant challenges as a new learner are learning how to code properly and use GitHub, HTML. An advantage of GitHUb and HTML that I noticed were the ability to organize things easily into lists and being able to view the code in a web browser to see your changes as you make them. An advantage of using WordPress is that you don't have to worry about coding and using HTML elements correctly, unless you like coding. A challenge to these methods are getting used to coding and using different HTML elements, sizing and editing images, and troubleshooting issued with your code. Some of the skills that I've developed during while making this website were being able to code and use HTML properly, understanding what the different HTML and GitHub elements/commands mean and do, learning how to (kind of) format and create a resume. Some things that I want to further develop with my website are being able to do more than the minimum of what is asked, or to make it look more aesthetically pleasing.
